# SQL_Practice
Showing my knowledge of SQL through practice problems from sources such as Leetcode

**NOTE:** This is not intended to showcase any sort of competitive skill or mastery of SQL at all. It's simply just proof that I translate simple tasks in SQL queries, and that I took the time to actively practice.
